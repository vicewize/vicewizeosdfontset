# VICEWIZE WTF-OS MSP-OSD Colorized Custom Font Package 

-Update w new glyths Oct 23 4:30PM Pacific-

These are still being built as you read this but if you feel like testing go for it! This is made for Betaflight currently but I will have Ardupilot and iNav versions available after I hand make the rest of the icon glyths. The files are already pre-named with the bf_ prefix to denote that it is a font for Betaflight. You obviously need to have rooted DJI V1/V2 googles and airunit/vista with the most up to date version of msp-osd in the package manager tab of the configurator, or just click on the WTF-OS tab and click update if already installed. 

Big Thanks go out to all the people who made WTF-OS, Margerine Exploit, and all the great packages a reality because with their hardwork none of this ould even be possible.

Who made this all possible: http://wtf.fpv.   :-)

Just copy the 4 files to the root of your SD card. Thats it! Enjoy!
