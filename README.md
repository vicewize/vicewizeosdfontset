# VICEWIZE HD Colorized Italic Font Set For FPV-WTF - MSP-OSD #

-BETAFLIGHT VERSION- Updated with fixes Tuesday Msrch 14 2023
Updated some ugly glypths I never liked and updated a few colors to a more simplistic look. Im working on 3 alternate new fonts, as well as getting the graphical battery working correctly which was always an issue (BF issue but corrected in 4.3). Anyways enjoy.

TO INSTALL:

Unzip the package and copy all 4 of the .bin files which are already prenamed with the bf prefix: font_bf.bin, font_bf_2.bin, font_bf_hd.bin, font_bf_hd2.bin, to the root of the SD card in your DJI googles. Thats it!

Enjoy!


Any issues or requests just let me know and ill do my best to get back at you.

If wondering how I overlayed the msp-osd elements on the video below, I used Knifa's online msp-osd overlay tool (still in development). Your DVR will save a .osd file with the same name as the video file, combine those two and the 4 fonts from your sd card and it re-renders within the browser.
