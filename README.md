# VICEWIZE HD Colorized Italic Font Set For FPV-WTF - MSP-OSD #

-BETAFLIGHT VERSION-

This is a complete font file package (4 font files) in .bin format, which are precompiled. To make use of the custom font and custom color HD glyths you must first have a rooted set of DJI V1 / V2 FPV googles, and the airunit/airunit-lite (vista) must also be rooted as well. Go to http://fpv.wtf for full online configurator, rooting tool, and package installer. Install the MSP-OSD package on both devices (always check for updates to newest versions), under the package manager tab. You must enable the FAKE HD key option on the googles under the CLI tab, as well as place the throttle element (which can be changed to another element, or hidden) and read about the way the screen will be split, or centered, or modified to your choosing and the way the rows and columns are layed out. This is completly customizable but entering the relevent package config row setup in the online CLI tool. All relevent info is on the MSP-OSD github page with how-to's and commands.

TO INSTALL:

Unzip the package and copy all 4 of the .bin files which are already prenamed with the bf prefix: font_bf.bin, font_bf_2.bin, font_bf_hd.bin, font_bf_hd2.bin, to the root of the SD card in your DJI googles. Thats it!

Enjoy!
