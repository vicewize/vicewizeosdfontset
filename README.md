# VICEWIZE WTF-FPV - MSP-OSD - Colorized Custom Font Package 

-Updated WED NOV 26TH-


WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Important: This has been created with very helpful input from the WTF-FPV Discord and shout outs to everyone that contributed ideas. Thank you!

These are still being built as you read this but if you feel like testing go for it! This is made for Betaflight currently but I will have Ardupilot and iNav versions available after I hand make the rest of the icon glyths. The files are already pre-named with the bf_ prefix to denote that it is a font for Betaflight. You obviously need to have rooted DJI V1/V2 googles and airunit/vista with the most up to date version of msp-osd in the package manager tab of the configurator, or just click on the WTF-OS tab and click update if already installed. 

Big Thanks go out to all the people who made WTF-OS, Margerine Exploit, and all the great packages a reality because with their hardwork none of this ould even be possible.

Who made this all possible: http://wtf.fpv.   :-)

Just copy the 4 files to the root of your SD card. Thats it! Enjoy!
