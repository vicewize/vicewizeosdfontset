# VICEWIZE HD Colorized Italic Font Set For WTF-FPV - MSP-OSD 

-Updated Mon Oct 31th-

100% working, I will add more glyths as I find the time but you can download and have a fully working OSD, go to releases and download the newest release. Copy the 4 files in the zip archive to to root of your SD card of your DJI googles. Enjoy!

WORK IN PROGRESS!!
