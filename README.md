# VICEWIZE MSP-OSD Colorized Custom Font Package

These are still being built as you read this but if you feel like testing go for it! This is made for Betaflight currently but I will have Ardupilot and iNav versions available after I hand make the rest of the icon glyths. The files are already pre-named with the bf_ prefix to denote that it is a font for Betaflight.

Just copy the 4 files to the root of your SD card. Thats it! Enjoy!
